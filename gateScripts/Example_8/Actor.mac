# ABOUT THIS MACRO
# Description: This macro  describes what and when save from simulation to output file.
# One of methods is using Global and Local Actor. Local Actor can be attached to selected
# volume in simulation system and observe each one track (particle) propagating throw this
# volume. You can choose which data save and when ( e.g. save data only for gammas which
# has scattered in Compton process). Global take under consideration this conditions 
# and save data only for particles which met the conditions. Output file can be read
# by Global Actor Reader or in the another way by ROOT Framework.
